Introduction

1. Background
  Relocation has been a serious challenge for people who want to make a decision in a metropolitan area, \r\n in which many factors should be taken into consideration. All those factors have different weights in each different individual, for example, some people care more for the community environment, while some people care more for the prices of homes. After the combination of those different factors, the final choice could vary a lot among each person. Therefore, there’s no way to develop a standard or universal way to find the best relocation choice for everyone. However, based on each customer’s preference, some key factors could be investigated with data analysis process. By exploring the data from public resources, including Zillow and Foursquare, such analysis will lead to a customized result to be provided to meet customers’ interest and requirement to the utmost extent.
