Introduction

1. Background
  Relocation and house moving have been a serious challenge for people who want to make a decision in a metropolitan 
  area, in which many factors should be taken into consideration. All those factors have different weights in each 
  different individual, for example, some people care more for the community environment, while some people 
  care more for the prices of homes. After the combination of those different factors, the final choice could
  vary a lot among each person. Therefore, there’s no way to develop a standard or universal way to find the 
  best relocation choice for everyone. However, based on each customer’s preference, some key factors could be
  investigated with data analysis process. By exploring the data from public resources, including Zillow and 
  Foursquare, such analysis will lead to a customized result to be provided to meet customers’ interest and 
  requirement to the utmost extent.
2. Problem
  In the house moving and relocation analysis, many people care about the community location and the environment
  arount it. Also, prices is an important factor for house purchase. The problem is to find the optimized choice among
  many neighborhoods based on the current interested parameters, by applying clusters and performing data analysis.
3. Interest
  In this project, the neighborhoods around Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington metropolitan will be analyzed from 
  venue types, prices and home value increasing percentage for the future, and the analysis will result in a relocation
  reference to a customer pre-assuming to move from St. Paul to Minneapolis as an example.
